Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by 
category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

My asnwer: probably not. We can not create two or more constructors 
having the same number of prameters and same type of parameters. Because
this will cause "overloading constructors" and the compiler of Java can 
not identify the difference between two constructors (base on the number
of parameters and type of parameters)
